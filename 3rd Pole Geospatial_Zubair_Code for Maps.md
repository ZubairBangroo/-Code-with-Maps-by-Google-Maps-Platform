### A Brief of the Prototype:
  This section must include UML Diagrams and prototype description
The problem we are addressing, "Enhancing Bicycle Racing Events Promotion & House Renting with Google Maps API," involves two distinct yet interconnected challenges:
1. Bicycle Racing Event Promotion: Organizing and promoting bicycle racing events can be a complex task, especially when it comes to effectively reaching the target audience and providing them with essential event information. Cyclists and event organizers often face challenges related to finding and sharing race routes, race timings, and location-specific details. Addressing this problem involves creating a platform that allows event organizers to easily showcase their races, including interactive maps displaying the race routes, time schedules, and race-specific information. On the other side, cyclists and enthusiasts need a user-friendly interface to discover upcoming events, view detailed race routes, and register for races.
2. House Renting: Finding suitable accommodation, whether for a short-term stay or an extended period, can also be a daunting task. Rental platforms often come with various listings, but there can be issues related to authenticity and direct communication with property owners. This solution aims to streamline the house renting process by providing a platform where property owners can directly list their houses or apartments. Renters, in turn, can easily search for properties, view their locations on a map, and communicate directly with property owners. By enhancing transparency and direct communication, this solution simplifies the process of finding and renting a house or apartment, making it more convenient and efficient for both property owners and renters.
Our project intends to offer a comprehensive solution that improves the way not only bicycle racing events but other events including live musical shows, conferences, horse or bike race tracks, etc. But here we have used an example of a Bicycle race that is promoted and how individuals find and rent accommodation. It leverages the power of the Google Maps API to provide location-based services, ultimately enhancing user experiences for both event promotion and house renting.

In this code:
Replace OUR_API_KEY with our actual Google Maps API key.
The page initializes the Google Map with a default center and zoom level.
Users can enter a location in the input field and click "Add Marker" to place a marker on the map at the specified location.
Please note that this is a basic example. In a complete project, you would likely save the marker locations to a database, allow users to interact with the markers, and implement more features as needed for your specific use case.


Creating a full-fledged prototype of a system that enhances bicycle racing event promotion and house renting with the Google Maps API is a complex task that would involve various technologies and a significant amount of code. Here, I'll provide you with an outline of how you can structure your code and integrate the Google Maps API for the bicycle racing event promotion part. This outline will be for the front-end, and you would need to implement the back-end as well as database interactions for a complete solution.

Set up JavaScript to load the Google Maps API and display a map.
// Replace 'OUR_API_KEY' with your actual Google Maps API key
const apiKey = 'OUR_API_KEY';

function initMap() {
    // Initialize the map
    const map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
        center: { lat: 0, lng: 0 }, // Set the initial center of the map
        zoom: 8 // Set the initial zoom level
    });

    // You can add markers and other functionality here
}

// Load the Google Maps API
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.src = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=${apiKey}&callback=initMap`;
script.defer = true;
script.async = true;
document.head.appendChild(script);
